# Bubble-Solution-Manufacturing-Solution

# Description

This program emulates a fictional company engaged in the production of bubble solutions. Each unique bubble solution undergoes rigorous testing, and its performance is quantified by the number of bubbles it produces. The dataset comprises 50 distinct bubble solutions. Additionally, access was granted to a separate dataset that provides the price associated with each bubble solution. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights from this data. Specifically, the aim is to accomplish the following:
1.	List Bubble Solution Scores: Present a comprehensive list of scores for all tested bubble solutions.
2.	Total Number of Bubble Solutions Tested: It is essential to know the total count of bubble solutions evaluated.
3.	Highest Bubble Score: Identifying the solution with the highest bubble score is crucial for quality assessment.
4.	Top-Scoring Solution(s): Highlight the solution(s) that achieved the highest score.
5.	Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: By combining the bubble scores and their corresponding prices, the most cost-effective bubble solution can be determined.

To achieve these objectives, we will employ the following programming constructs:
*	Loops (both for and while loops) to iterate through the datasets.
*	Variables to store relevant information.
*	Data structures (lists) to organize and manipulate the data.
*	The random module for any arbitrary processes.
*	The range function to generate sequences of numbers.
*	The length function to determine the size of datasets.
*	The round function for precision when necessary.
*	F-strings for clear and concise output formatting.
*	Boolean expressions to filter and select specific data points.
*	Conditional statements (if statements) to handle different scenarios.

By skillfully combining these elements, this program can analyze bubble solution data efficiently and provides valuable insights for our fictional company.
